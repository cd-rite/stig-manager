## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are grateful for anyone reporting a vulnerability, helping us to make STIG Manager better and more secure. Additionally, we encourage everyone to disclose bugs in a responsible way, allowing us and other STIGMan users to react accordingly in a timely manner. That means:

- If you want to report a critical bug that could: allow someone to steal credentials, execute code or escalate privileges, please send a bug report to xxxxxxxxxxx@xxxx.com before publishing it. This allows us to fix it, create a new version and allows other STIGMan users to update before the information is out in the wild. After receiving the bug report, we will immediately get back to you to coordinate the required action.
- If you want to report a non-critical bug, write to  xxxxxxxxxxx@xxxx.com or open an issue on github.
- This is an open source project. If you discover a bug and fix it, you are very welcome to submit a PR. You will be rewarded with the everlasting gratitude of the STIGMan team and the community!

Thanks for managing your STIGs with STIG Manager!
